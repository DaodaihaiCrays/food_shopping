# Shooping Food

• I built a Flutter-based food ordering app with separate user and admin roles. Users can browse dishes, manage their cart and
wallet, while admins can add new dishes categorized by type  
• I used Firebase Firestore to store user profiles, cart items, and categorized dish information.  
• I implemented login, registration, and password reset via email using the firebase auth package.  
• I integrated image upload functionality for admin users when adding dishes using the image picker package.  
• I applied shared preferences to locally store user data, including user id, email, and wallet balance.  

**Technologies used:**  
- Flutter  
- Firebase Firestore  
- Firebase Authentication  
- image_picker  
- shared_preferences
